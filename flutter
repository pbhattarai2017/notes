Flutter SDK for cross-platform mobile app development
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Download and setup 'flutter SDK' from flutter.io
2. Download and setup 'Visual Studio Code' and install 'Dart' & 'Flutter' package.
3. Start developing flutter app.


Create your first mobile app from flutter:
------------------------------------------
1. Go to your project directory
2. Create a flutter project by executing following command:
	$ flutter create first_app
3. Browse and open first_app directory from VSCode.
4. Erase all text from 'lib/main.dart' and write the following code
	_______________________________________
	import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
	
	void main() {
		runApp(FirstApp());
	}

	class FirstApp extends StatelessWidget {
		@override
		Widget build(BuildContext context) {
			return MaterialApp(
				title: 'My First Application',
				home: Scaffold(
					appBar: AppBar(title: 'Home Screen'),
					body: Text('Hello World')	
				)			
			);
		}
	}
	________________________________________

Congrats, you have created your first application.
To install it in your phone, install:
	* first_app/build/app/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
This is a debug version of your app. We will later see how to release an app.

If you want to build release version from the latest codebase:
$ flutter clean
$ flutter build apk

This will generate the latest .apk file for you application. Now share it with your friends.
